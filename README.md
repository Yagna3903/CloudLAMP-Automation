**One-click Cloud LAMP Deployment**  

This project provisions **AWS infrastructure** using **Terraform**, configures a full **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) with **Ansible**, and deploys a sample PHP application.  

### Designed as a **Cloud + DevOps project** to demonstrate:  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
- Automated server configuration (Ansible)  
- Cloud deployment (AWS EC2)  
- CI/CD & GitHub Actions integration  

---

## 📌 Features
- **Infrastructure as Code** – reproducible AWS environments.  
- **Automated LAMP stack** – Apache, MySQL, PHP setup in minutes.  
- **Idempotent configuration** – safe re-runs with Ansible.  
- **CI/CD ready** – integrated GitHub Actions for lint/test.  
- **Documentation & diagrams** for easy onboarding.

## 🏗️ Architecture
Terraform provisions -> AWS EC2 + SG + EIP  
Ansible configures -> Apache + MySQL + PHP  
App deployed -> Accessible via Elastic IP.
